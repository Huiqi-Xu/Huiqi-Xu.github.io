## Courses

I am learning the following courses:

- Master Course Introduction to Computational Communication
- Master Course Network Data Analytics
- Master Course Advanced Statistics
- Master Course Integrated Marketing Communications


## Academic Writing
With a strong interest in big data and digital technology, I try to make some academic writing focusing on employing big data and computational methods to analyze digital marketing effectiveness, consumer behavior.
- I produce an empirical study titled **Improving Online Instruction Interaction in Greater Bay Area Universities: Strategies under China's Digital Education Strategy**（《教育数字化战略下粤港澳大湾区高校在线教学交互效果研究及提升策略》），which explores the influence of online teaching interaction on students' learningengagement under the education digitization strategy.
- Under the background of the rise of domestic digital brands and products, I commit a survey **The Rise of Domestic 3C Brands: An Analysis of Chinese Youth's Domestic Product Perception and Consumer Behavior in the New Era**（《国货 3C 数码品牌崛起:基于消费者行为分析的新时代中国青年国货观》）that explored the concept of Chinese youth on domestic digital brands in the new era.
